# Coding Challenge
   Build a “Like” button feature
  - This feature needs to be easily added to an article.
  - The “Like” button serves two primary use cases:
    - When a user visits an article, a like button is rendered and displays the total number of likes
    -When a user clicks the like button, the count increments by one.
  - How would the client-side, server-side + database be strucutured?

## Bonus challenge
  - How can you improve the feature to make it more resilient against abuse/exploitation
  - How can you improve the feature to make it scale to millions of users and perform without issues?
  - A million concurrent users clicking the button at the same time
  - A million concurrent users requesting the article's like count at the same time
